We predict mandi prices using Time-Series analysis for common commodities to help farmers sell their product and the best rate possible and 
manage their produce much more efficiently

The code I've uplaoded is the basic sample analysis to decide which Time series model to fit the data on and what additional parameters that can be chosen. Keeping
in mind the privacy issues of the project, I've only uploaded the sample code and data.
We've created a flask app that directly streamlines the ODK survey data, into the model, onto a graph for farmers to easily understand what to do.
We expect farmer income to rise by around 40% as a direct implication of our model

This project was a part of Google's AI for social good, a team of students from BITS Hyderabad and IIT Delhi collaborated on this.
